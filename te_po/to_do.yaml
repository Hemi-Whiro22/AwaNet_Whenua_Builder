# To-Do List for Backend Review

- Validate TOOL_REGISTRY:
    - Ensure all tools required by `kitenga_backend.py` are registered in `openai_tools.json`.
    - Verify that tools listed in `openai_assistants.json` are functional and accessible.

- Test Endpoints:
    - Test `/tools/run` endpoint for dynamic tool invocation.
    - Test `/tools/list` endpoint to ensure all tools are listed correctly.

- Refactor Code:
    - Modularize `kitenga_backend.py` by extracting reusable logic.
    - Simplify `kitenga_tool_router.py` for better maintainability.

- Write Tests:
    - Add unit tests for `run_tool` and `list_tools` endpoints.
    - Add integration tests for workflows like `process_document` and `query_knowledge_base`.

- Push Changes:
    - Commit and push validated changes to GitHub.
    - Monitor Render deployment for any issues.
