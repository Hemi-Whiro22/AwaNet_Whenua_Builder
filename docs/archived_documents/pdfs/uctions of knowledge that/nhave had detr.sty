uctions of knowledge that\nhave had detrimental effects for them (Walker, 1996; Pihama, 1994). Rangatahi M\u0101ori are therefore\ndoubly disadvantaged given that they are M(cid:407)ori and subject to all the ills of te ao M\u0101ori (the M(cid:407)ori\nworld). Rangatahi M\u0101ori are therefore labelled \u201cat risk\u201d without any consideration of listening to their\nown stories as a means of creating positive solutions to issues.\nThis research offers opportunities for rangatahi to define what hauora (well-being) means for them to\nhave the opportunity to be researchers and play a central role in the research process, to work alongside\npakeke (adults) to write and deliver findings to various forums, and to offer a contribution to youth\nhauora and youth development that directly impacts on the lives of rangatahi M\u0101ori.\nThis research team \u2018Wh(cid:407)ia te Hauora o ng(cid:407) Rangatahi\u2019 is discovering with each step of the research\njourney that rangatahi M\u0101ori should not be denied the opportunity to exercise agency over their lives\nand therefore they play an important role as researchers and participants in the research project, and in\nturn unique approaches to the research have developed.\nBackground to the research\nIn 2002, Te R\u016bnanga o Raukawa Incorporated secured funding from the Health Research Council\n(HRC) and the Foundation for Research Science and Technology (FRST). The research was to look at\nthe health and well-being of rangatahi M\u0101ori. Te R\u016bnanga o Raukawa was chosen to umbrella the\nproject because it is an iwi (tribal) organisation that had a strong presence throughout the Manawat\u016b,\nHorowhenua and K(cid:407)piti areas; it had established health and social services and was interested in\nexpanding into research and development. In addition, in order to strengthen the iwi position\ncollaborative relationships with a number of stakeholders were integral to the development and on-\ngoing operation of this research project. The creation of an advisory committee which represented a\nvariety of interest groups was developed to oversee the project. Initial advice was sought from Professor\nMason Durie and Professor Whatarangi Winiata as recognised exponents in the iwi and research\nterrains, both of whom would then nominate representatives on the advisory committee. Other advisory\ncommittee members came from Te R\u016bnanga o Raukawa Inc executive, the School of Sociology, Social\nPolicy and Social Work (Massey University), Te Mana Tuku Iho, Highbury Wh(cid:407)nau Centre and\nWesley Community Action. Several rangatahi are also represented on the advisory committee.\nTe R\u016bnanga o Raukawa has previously established relationships with all of these groups, but this\nproject offered yet another opportunity to strengthen the relationship between the various organisations.\nIn one instance a Memorandum of Understanding was established.\nThe project would be undertaken within the geographical boundaries of Ng(cid:407)ti Raukawa, but would\ninclude rangatahi M\u0101ori from any iwi. Given that the research was being conducted under the auspices\n179\n\nof Te R\u016bnanga o Raukawa there was a real possibility for wh\u0101nau (family groups), hap\u016b (sub-tribes)\nand iwi focus. While this might intimate bias on one level, on another it should be seen as a unique\nopportunity to gather information from within a wh\u0101nau/hap\u016b/iwi domain.\nMost research is still conducted within research institutions or universities, but iwi and M(cid:407)ori\nindividuals and organisations have aspired to be in control of their own research, believing that they\ncould rectify the negative imagery long seen as an outcome of research by having strong strengths and\nsolutions focussed research. This research, the research topic, the researchers and the iwi organisation\noffer various opportunities to create new relationships, methods and research findings to the field of\nrangatahi M\u0101ori and hauora. The two methods that have underpinned this research project are:\n1. participatory action research which suggests a process which results in social change for\nthose the research is about\n2. Kaupapa M\u0101ori (M(cid:407)ori philosophies and methodologies) that addresses the research from a\nuniquely M(cid:407)ori world view.\nResearch approaches\n1. Participatory action research sets out to \u201ccreate new forms of knowledge through a creative\nsynthesis of the different understandings and experiences of those who take part\u201d (Rice and\nEzzy, 1999, p. 173). Therefore, this research allows rangatahi M\u0101ori as researchers and\nparticipants the opportunity to convey their own experiences in a manner that hopefully\nimpacts positively on their own health and well-being. Participatory action research also\nattempts to achieve rangatahi desired outcomes by valuing the experiences of the participants\nand giving rangatahi a sense of ownership over the research. A commitment to integrated\nrangatahi involvement meant ensuring that the process was appropriate to the rangatahi\nparticipants, and empowered rangatahi to see themselves as agents of change within their\nown contexts (Munford and Walsh-Tapiata, 2001). A research project that undertakes\nparticipatory action research also requires a combination of active participation, education\nand collective action with and by rangatahi. \u2018Wh(cid:407)ia te Hauora o ng(cid:407) Rangatahi\u2019 has a team\nof researchers with very diverse backgrounds, with both adults and rangatahi who are fully\ncommitted to this project. It has been important however that the team has a clear\nunderstanding of the particular research approaches utilised in the project and there is regular\nreflection of this across the whole project.\n2. Kaupapa M\u0101ori research has a myriad of interpretations, each different and unique to the\nparticular circumstances though there are also some common threads to this indigenous\nphilosophy. Perhaps the most overarching notion is that Kaupapa M\u0101ori is unique to M(cid:407)ori\nand challenges the ideologies of cultural superiority by looking towards the development of a\nphilosophy that takes into account being and acting M(cid:407)ori, it is grounded in a M(cid:407)ori world\nview, and it takes for granted the validity and legitimacy of M(cid:407)ori, the importance of M(cid:407)ori\nlanguage and culture, as well as being concerned with the \u2018struggle for autonomy over our\nown cultural well-being\u2019 (Graham Smith cited in Mead, 1996, p. 202). It is research \u2018over\nwhich M(cid:407)ori maintain conceptual, design, methodological and interpretative control\u2019 (Smith,\n1995, p. 1), that acknowledges the diverse realities of M(cid:407)ori (Durie, 1994), and that centres\nM(cid:407)ori values, attitudes and practices in research by ensuring that they are not lost amongst\nwesternised labels (Tuhiwai-Smith, 1999); given that \u201cthere is still not enough literature,\nguidance around issues that concern indigenous communities, minority group researchers,\ncarrying out research within their own communities\u201d (Smith, 1995, p. 8). Kaupapa M\u0101ori\nresearch has offered a culturally acceptable approach in which to work through some of these\nissues. Unfortunately there is even less knowledge that pertains to rangatahi M\u0101ori and\ntherefore this approach is appropriate as it allows research to be undertaken with rangatahi\nM\u0101ori while creating unique methods as a part of the research process.\n180\n\nTikanga M(cid:407)ori\nWithin a Kaupapa M\u0101ori perspective one of the challenges for the research team has been an\nunderstanding and the application of tikanga (customary practices). Tikanga being \u2018the way things are\ndone according to M(cid:407)ori custom\u2019 (Mead, 2003, p. 11). They are the practices, customs and/or habits of\nthe individual or the collective. Mead suggests that tikanga is most publicly associated to negative\nactions of the individual, but that tikanga should be acknowledged and further utilised to produce\npositive outcomes, especially in contemporary times where \u2018M(cid:407)ori society is subject to every\ntemptation that is known to the Western world\u2019 (Mead, 2003, p. 247). In the research context tikanga\noffers a set of guidelines about how research might or might not occur, ultimately leading towards\npositive outcomes for M(cid:407)ori communities.\nA number of M(cid:407)ori researchers such as (Durie, 1994; Mead, 1996; Ruwhiu, 1994; Smith, 1995; 2003;\nTuhiwai Smith, 1999) have written about principles that they believe should underpin quality research\nin the Iwi/M(cid:407)ori terrain. Arohia Durie believes that these principles are all informed by tikanga. The\nprinciples are:\n\u2022 mana (authority) ensuring the individual and collective mana of the group is maintained (a\nprinciple also supported by writers like Ruwhiu and Winiata)\n\u2022 mauri (life principle) or special character acknowledging that tribal intellectual knowledge is\naccepted and upheld\n\u2022 mahitahi (co-operation) between the research and the researched to ensure shared monitoring\nof the process is maintained, and\n\u2022 m\u0101ramatanga (understanding) that a positive contribution to the expressed needs and\naspirations of M(cid:407)ori are accomplished (cited in Jahnke and Taiapa, 2003, p. 46).\nGraham Smith offers other principles which include knowledge and understanding of concepts such as\nwhakapapa (genealogy), wh\u0101nau, hap\u016b and iwi, te reo M\u0101ori (the M(cid:407)ori language), tikanga and\nrangatiratanga (self determination) (cited in Mead, 1996). Mead (1996, pp. 210-213) suggests that:\n\u2022 aroha ki te tangata (a respect for people)\n\u2022 kanohi kitea (to have a physical presence)\n\u2022 titiro, whakarongo\u2026 korero (look, listen\u2026 speak)\n\u2022 manaaki tangata (look after people)\n\u2022 kia tupato (be cautious)\n\u2022 kaua e takahia te mana o te tangata (do not trample over the integrity of people), and\n\u2022 kia m\u0101haki (be humble)\nare all principles that are important in the research terrain of M(cid:407)ori. These writers (amongst others) all\nbelieve that when undertaking research in M(cid:407)ori communities you must have a set of tikanga or\nprinciples that guide your practice, and in this instance the principles are derived from a M(cid:407)ori world\nview.\nThe rangatahi researchers involved in this project believe that tikanga offers not only a foundation in\nwhich to undertake the research, but in turn allows unique and distinctive methods to be established as a\npart of the research process. This article considers some of the methods used by this research project,\nwhich utilises aspects of tikanga.\nTikanga has been important to this research process with the principles guiding safe practice as\nresearchers in iwi/M(cid:407)ori and rangatahi terrains. Iwi manage the research project and all the researchers\nand participants are M(cid:407)ori, so it is not unusual to see a M(cid:407)ori paradigm such as tikanga as a guide to the\npractice, however, it should not be assumed that tikanga principles are a give in. The influence of\nWestern research and the continuing development of M(cid:407)ori research methods appropriate to the context\nmean that the use of tikanga needs a purposeful choice in research projects and to be constantly\nreviewed in terms of use of development of ideas. Each step and stage of this project has had to be\nnegotiated in terms of the appropriate use of tikanga, given the particular iwi context and the age group\nthat are the focus of the research.\n181\n\nMethods\nRecruiting Rangatahi\nIn order to recruit rangatahi researchers, cultural processes were utilised (attending marae and hap\u016b\nmeetings, hui rangatahi, talking with adults and M(cid:407)ori organisations) rather than the conventional\nmeans of advertising in newspapers. Te R\u016bnanga o Raukawa was one of the organisations approached\nto recommend rangatahi from within their hap\u016b. One koroua (male elder) from this forum used his\nwhakapapa connections and wrote a list of rangatahi from the seven marae (focal meeting place of\nkinship groups) he was connected to. We then visited all the families and explained about the research\nproject and said that someone would be contacting the rangatahi. Acting as a go-between he ensured\neasy access to the wh\u0101nau and the rangatahi. Several of the rangatahi that ended up as rangatahi\nresearchers came to the project as a result of this process. These rangatahi had choices for two\ncompletely different reasons, on one hand they were told by their wh\u0101nau and their koroua that they\nshould become involved with this research, but were also told by the research team that it was their\npersonal choice as to whether they became involved in the project. While it might be perceived that\nthere was wh\u0101nau/koroua pressure, these rangatahi have since expressed appreciation that their koroua\nhad the foresight to approach them as they now realise that involvement in this project has provided a\nnumber of opportunities for them. Recently this koroua retired from his job of working with youth in\nhis community and now keeps the paepae (orator\u2019s bench) warm at his marae. However, he remains\ncritically conscious of the need to have young people following in his footsteps. He chairs the advisory\ncommittee responsible for the research oversight of the project, regularly visits the project and more\nrecently this koroua supported one of his mokopuna (grandchildren) to successfully apply for a research\nposition in the team. Regular visits to the project also provide him with feedback about all of his\nmokopuna involved in the project.\nA number of M(cid:407)ori youth organisations were also invited to recommend rangatahi between the ages of\n15-24 years who might be interested in being involved as rangatahi researchers on this project. Adults\nin the research team, given their knowledge of rangatahi in the geographical area also approached\nrangatahi they knew or knew about. There was also a second phase of rangatahi recruitment where the\ncurrent rangatahi researchers used a form of snow-balling (Patton, 2002) to recommend further\nrangatahi who might be interested in the project.\nRangatahi were invited to an initial hui (meeting) to hear about the research project. Rangatahi who\nattended this hui were already involved in youth related activities such as youth councils and youth\nleadership programmes or simply \u201cbecause koro said\u201d. About a dozen rangatahi became involved in\nthe research working alongside two adults. No rangatahi was turned away, however, along the way\nthree rangatahi left the project, one having obtained permanent employment, one moved and one didn\u2019t\nreturn to further hui.\nIn establishing the team there needed to be an awareness of the various activities that the rangatahi\nwere already involved in given the importance of the inclusion of their voice at every stage of the\nresearch as well as training them in the various aspects of research, their timetables would play a critical\nrole in when the interviews were undertaken (mainly during school holidays). Regular hui were also\nheld to update the rangatahi of the research progress and to inform them of any up and coming events\nas part of their ongoing commitment to the group in any given month.\nHaving consolidated the group of rangatahi researchers, the project then identified possible rangatahi\ngroups to approach who might be interested in participating in the research. A matrix of the range of\nrangatahi groups in the geographical area was designed using variables such as urban-rural based,\ndiffering educational settings, gender and high-low risk rangatahi. A number of groups were then\nidentified. In conjunction with advice from the research advisory committee six groups were chosen to\napproach in order to gauge their interest in participating in the project, inclusive of focus group and\nindividual interviews in the first phase. All six groups that were approached agreed to participate in the\nproject and were based within the iwi boundaries of Ng(cid:407)ti Raukawa and the surrounding community.\nWhakapapa connections played a critical role in accessing some of the organisations. It was not always\na guarantee but in some instances it was a foot in the door for gaining access to groups of rangatahi.\nThree of the organisations were iwi or hap\u016b based organisations, two others were urban based, but\nacknowledged Ng(cid:407)ti Raukawa as one of the tangata whenua (indigenous people) in the area of Kapiti-\n182\n\nHorowhenua-Manawat\u016b-Rangitikei. The final group also had a relationship with Ng(cid:407)ti Raukawa given\nthat they were situated in the Ng(cid:407)ti Raukawa rohe (geographical area) were rural and were known to\nsome of the researchers. The groups included a school, an iwi education programme, a small rural town\nyouth programme, a leadership programme and two alternative education programmes, one based in a\ncity and the other based at a marae. All of the organisations were Iwi or M(cid:407)ori groups.\nHaving gained access from the organisations was one part of a process with the other part being the\nconsideration and approval of the rangatahi from the group to be participants. Where possible we asked\nto meet with the rangatahi, spoke to them about the research, used our rangatahi researchers to run\nexercises which helped ensure rangatahi appropriate approaches, and then finishing with an exercise\nwhere they could indicate their interest in being involved. While we gained adult approval from the\norganisations, rangatahi approval would ensure participants. The formal and informal relationships\nestablished between the various parties were pivotal in ensuring numbers for the interviews. The\nspecifics of our research tender stated that we would work specifically with iwi/M(cid:407)ori youth\norganisations. We became aware that this had the potential to be perceived as bias, however on the flip\nside this project offered a unique opportunity for M(cid:407)ori organisations and rangatahi M\u0101ori to be the\ncentral point of concern, rather than an add on or a small part of a much larger project.\nRangatahi-pakeke relationships\nThe Youth Development Strategy Aotearoa or New Zealand (Ministry of Youth Affairs, 2002)\nhighlights the importance of the youth voice in any youth development. Having adults who are\ncommitted to this principle is extremely important and vital for the success of this project. The adults\ninvolved have strongly advocated for the youth voice to be heard throughout every phase of the project,\nand have a consciousness of the importance of the role of young people however, in addition the\nrangatahi monitor the project as well as the adults from their perspective. For the adults it is a daily\nchallenge working with rangatahi and at their pace.\nAs Tuhiwai Smith et al (2002, p. 170), states \u201cyouth have insightful views and analyses of our society,\nhave solutions to offer and would be willing to voice those if invited\u201d. This research endeavours to\nlisten to and hear the voice of rangatahi M\u0101ori, to allow them to mould the shape of the research as\nwell as developing youth appropriate research methods. This project also set out to involve rangatahi in\na research process that was driven by them and to encourage them to voice their opinions. For many this\nwas a foreign experience. The combination of young people and adults has ensured joint ownership and\nhas given us \u201cthe confidence that our research was well grounded and reflected the daily reality of\nparticipants\u2019 experiences\u201d (Munford and Sanders, 2003, p. 103).\nIn addition to a youth development perspective there has also been a tikanga process in relation to\nrangatahi-pakeke relationships. Each adult has had to establish what their relationship is with that\nparticular rangatahi or group of rangatahi. While some pakeke may have waited to identify the nature\nof their relationship with the rangatahi, the rangatahi clearly stated what these relationships would be.\nFor example the project manager was called Whaea (mother or aunt) by all of the rangatahi (whatever\ntheir age). Some of this may have been in respect to her position, but for many of the rangatahi she was\nknown to be of their parents\u2019 generation. While the two faces of the coin once again show a youth\ndevelopment perspective on one side and a tikanga perspective on the other, both can be compatible\ngiven open and honest relationships with all parties.\nFocus group interviews\nThe use of qualitative research methods such as focus group interviews and in-depth individual\ninterviews enabled the experiences and stories of the young people to be explored. Reinharz (1988,\npp. 15-16) further states that \u201c\u2026if you want to hear it, you have to go hear it, in their space, or in a safe\nspace\u201d. It was important that the participants feel comfortable in sharing their experiences and stories so\n\u201csafe spaces\u201d had to be identified in order for the researchers to \u201chear it like it is\u201d (Tuhiwai Smith et al,\n2002). Like other adolescents, rangatahi M\u0101ori have grown up with fallacies that age, life experience\nand skills are barriers to their active participation in finding positive solutions to their hauora issues.\nThis project offered the opportunity to demystify these myths and empower rangatahi to have their\nvoice heard.\n183\n\nIn phase one of the research, focus group interviews were conducted. In order to ensure that the\ninterview schedule was youth focused and youth driven training sessions were held that looked at the\ntypes of questions that would be asked and the kinds of activities that would keep youth engaged. All\naspects of the interview schedule were piloted with the youth researchers and adapted accordingly. In\ndeveloping the questions it was important for the young people to have input to ensure that the\nquestions were contextualised within their own experiences and informed by their knowledge of what\nworks or doesn\u2019t work when researching young M(cid:407)ori. These methods and exercises allowed\ninformation to be gathered in a way that was youth friendly and non-threatening.\nThe interview for each focus group was undertaken jointly by both rangatahi and adults. The focus\ngroup interview included a range of information gathering mediums such as ice breakers, brainstorming\nor mind mapping, group activities and an individual exercise called the \u2018secret box\u2019 (Punch, 2002).\nDurie (1996) maintains that it is important to find methods that are appropriate in the design of the\nproject that incorporates a M(cid:407)ori world view and reflects the diversity of M(cid:407)ori. Although many of the\nmethods used may not particularly appear to be methodologically \u2018M(cid:407)ori\u2019, having participants and\nresearchers who are both M(cid:407)ori and rangatahi have resulted in methods that are appropriate in this\ncontext. The group process and the different methods still enabled information rich data to be gathered.\nThe practice of tikanga is perhaps rarely acknowledged in a project where all concerned are M(cid:407)ori\nbecause practices such as karakia (prayers) or mihimihi (greetings), are seen as integral or natural\nprocesses. Tikanga processes like those identified by the fore mentioned writers were also used in the\nresearch interviews with each focus group session beginning with a karakia and mihimihi.\nWhakawhanaungatanga (building relationships) began through mihimihi where rangatahi were able to\nmake whakapapa links to others in the group as well as stating where they were from. Many stated with\npride their connections to hap\u016b and marae while others still understood the basic mihimihi process and\ncould at least acknowledge who they were. Given our knowledge of some of the participants and the\nadult-rangatahi relationships, we encouraged the rangatahi to feel comfortable about the use of te reo\nM\u0101ori. This was important given that for some English was their second language and it was a means of\nalso validating the use of their own language in yet another setting. Warm up exercises also encouraged\nwhakawhanaungatanga to occur within the group. These whakawhanaungatanga processes were seen\nas being similar to team building activities. Such activities were designed to create a safe environment\nand breakdown initial barriers, especially if rangatahi did not know each other well as was the case in\none group. The cultural importance of sharing food was also encouraged. Our rangatahi researchers\nadvised us that in order to ensure youth participation it was vital to provide food at all of the focus\ngroups. This meant that the research team comprised of an adult and rangatahi researcher conducting\nthe focus group interview with other team members were out the back preparing food. An overall\nbalance of the research process was ensured, \u2018ko te amorangi ki mua, ko te h\u0101pai o ki muri\u2019 (by\ncombining the wisdom of seniority and the exuberance of youth, success can be better achieved).\nWhile focus group interviews looked at the broader interpretations of hauora it also provided rangatahi\nresearchers with the opportunity to utilise the facilitation skills that they already possessed as well as\nthose that they had learnt in the training sessions. In the earlier sessions adults who had dominated the\nfacilitation of the interview began to step into the background as the young people stepped up and took\nover with the support of the adults involved. Rangatahi moved from assisting in the questions, handing\nout the materials and setting up of equipment to fully facilitating the sessions. The activities used\npromoted peer interaction and conversation while also enabling youth researchers to track which topics\nhad been addressed and which ones still needed attention. As a research process a true partnership was\nbeing created.\nAll rangatahi, whether they were rangatahi researchers or participants, appeared to be comfortable with\nthese types of tikanga processes. Given the diverse backgrounds of those participating in the research,\nthis created some surprise, particularly with regard to of the so-called high risk rangatahi who were\nparticipating. On reflection it was acknowledged that all of the organisations involved have strong\ntikanga foundations in their everyday practice. The fact that simple indigenous processes could easily\nbe followed by those participating in the project suggests that there is a level of consciousness around\n\u2018tikanga M\u0101ori\u2019 (M(cid:407)ori customary practices) and an understanding as to what is expected of the\nindividual at certain times.\n184\n\nThere is an on-going debate about the validity of \u2018insider\u2019 research as opposed to \u2018outsider\u2019 research\n(Patton, 2002). This research is very much situated within the \u2018insider\u2019 terrain as both adults and\nrangatahi had whakapapa connections with many of those participating in the research. In addition,\nmany of the rangatahi researchers came from one of the groups or had previously been a part of that\norganisation. It is the premise of this research group that being an insider ensured access; ensured strong\nrelationships with those involved and provided information rich data from the participants. The research\nprocess also had participants asking us when we were coming back.\nBy using collaborative approaches with communities as well as methodologies that are both culturally\nand age appropriate, this project aims to work towards positive solutions with regards to hauora issues\nfor rangatahi M\u0101ori and solutions that derive from rangatahi themselves. Involving rangatahi M\u0101ori in\nall aspects of the research process, from having representation on the advisory committee to being\nresearchers or participants ensures that rangatahi M\u0101ori are actively engaged at all levels of the project.\nThe active involvement of tikanga in part is associated to rangatahi ownership of the project invoking\nrangatahi to partake in their own rangatiratanga or right to determine and influence their own futures.\nThe tikanga processes have naturally evolved in part because these are everyday processes that\nrangatahi use in their lives, because of their respect for the adults involved in the project who use\ntikanga processes in their everyday lives, because of the tikanga utilised by the groups interviewed and\nlastly because culturally appropriate processes are a purposeful element of research in this context.\nConclusion\nThe preliminary findings of this research project have found that rangatahi solutions to rangatahi\nproblems benefit from an element of what the youth have named as \u2018tikanga\u2019. What this \u2018tikanga\u2019\nencompasses in their eyes needs further investigation; however there is a general agreement that tikanga\nis a central pou (pillar) in the way this research has been conducted and it is important in providing\npossible solutions for addressing youth issues.\nKaupapa M\u0101ori research methods ensure that a cultural framework, inclusive of tikanga is central to\nthis research project. In addition however participatory action research methods support a notion of \u2018by\nrangatahi M\u0101ori for rangatahi M\u0101ori\u2019 ensuring that rangatahi M\u0101ori is not only listened to but are also\nheard. This research acknowledges their potential and the mana of rangatahi as the future of the M(cid:407)ori\nworld.\nRangatahi researchers (Te R\u014dpu Whai) include:\nR\u012bria Arapere, Hohua Arapere, Sharn Webster, Amokura Tapiata, Te Aniwaniwa Gotty,\nHokowhitu Cook, Terewai Rikihana, Te Puawai Stretch-Logan, Kieran Brown, Rawiri Tapiata,\nPita Savage, Areti Metuamate-Tuatini, Tiaria Ransfield, Michael Moses, Mihikore Davis,\nIstarnia Peachey, Kiriona Pene, Mahinaarangi Baker.\nBibliography\nDurie, M.

For decades, our\nterritories have been impacted with transboundary pollution from surrounding industries and\nnon-native settlements. Our subsistence economy and entire ecosystem has been transformed,\nrequiring considerable economic, social and political adjustment.\nThe Haudenosaunee, bring our case to the United Nations to draw international attention to the\nenvironmental issues affecting the indigenous communities of North America.1\nAnd so the Elders led the Haudenosaunee people to the United Nations (UN), once again, on July the\n18th, 1995. This visit was to convene a Summit to address environmental damage on Haudenosaunee\nterritories. This UN visit by the Elders carries on a 50 year tradition by the Haudenosaunee, who have\ninterfaced with the United Nations for its entire 50 years of existence, and who are familiar with the\ninternational laws and policies which are intended to benefit indigenous peoples.\nOne such international policy is the Declaration of Principles of Indigenous Rights, which was\nsubmitted by a coalition of indigenous Non Governmental Organisations at the Fourth Assembly of the\nWorld Council of Indigenous Peoples, in Panama. This Declaration of an indigenous right of self-\ndetermination emphasises the need for the world to recognise and respect the view of indigenous\ntraditions, customs and culture; the need to give treaties full effect under national and international\nlaws; and the need to give indigenous peoples their rightful equal place at the negotiating tables across\nthe world.\nIn 1989, an Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention was adopted by the General Conference of the\nInternational Labour Organisation. They referenced the terms of the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention calls for action\nto be taken, to include measures which will ensure three things: (first) that indigenous peoples are on\n\u2018equal footing\u2019 in terms of rights and opportunities; (second) the promotion of social, economic and\ncultural rights of indigenous peoples\u2019 customs, traditions and institutions; and (third) assist indigenous\npeople in eliminating socio-economic gaps by encouraging sustainable development. The Convention\nalso addresses indigenous ownership of traditional lands and the right to participate in the use,\nmanagement and conservation of natural resources.2 Other areas addressed which may be of interest,\ninclude employment conditions, vocational training, social security and health and education.\nAnother international document of particular importance to indigenous peoples is Chapter 26 of Agenda\n21 of the Rio Summit, which recognises and strengthens the role of indigenous peoples and\ncommunities. The Haudenosaunee People went to Rio and together with other indigenous Non\nGovernmental Organisations, made a major contribution to the Rio Earth Summit in bringing about\nChapter 26 of Agenda 21\u2014the commitment of indigenous peoples to continue sustainable economic\npractices, and to provide strategies for sustainable development practices and coexistence which serve\nas models for the future survival of humanity on earth.\nAgenda 21 is perhaps the most comprehensive statement on the range of human needs to be addressed\nin all sectors of society, and in all corners of the world. It is truly intended to energise global action,\nsetting in motion a series of processes aimed at a number of critical issues that require specific\nattention, including human numbers, the social issues of poverty and equity, the dilemmas of\n1. Haudenosaunee Environmental Restoration Strategy: An Indigenous Strategy for Human Sustainability,\nSection(1), Introduction, p. 3, authored by Janice Whitney Annunziata, under the direction of and including\ncontributions by the Haudenosaunee Environmental Task Force (HETF). Several excerpts from this Strategy\nare included in this paper so no further citation is provided.\n2. Convention Articles 14 and 15, p. 57.\n189\n\ndeveloping, small-island states, the threats to ocean vitality due to over-exploitation of marine\nresources, land-based sources of pollution, and problems of consumption pattern and lifestyles.\nAgenda 21 also forcefully addresses the problems facing indigenous peoples and outlines a series of\nfeatures designed to align indigenous concerns with those of the international community, and give a\nfuller sense of urgency to these fundamental needs at the national level, as well as indigenous\nparticipation in issues which directly affect indigenous territories.\nChapter 26.5 of Agenda 21 recommends that international development and financial institutions and\ngovernments:\n(1) Appoint a special focal point within each international organisation, and organise annual\ninternational coordination meetings with Governments and indigenous organisations. These\nmeetings will develop a procedure within and between operational agencies to assist\nGovernments to ensure the view of indigenous people is incorporated in the design and\nimplementation of policies and programmes. Under this procedure, indigenous people and\ntheir communities should be informed and consulted and allowed to participate in national\ndecision-making, in particular regarding regional and international cooperative efforts. In\naddition, these policies and programmes should take fully into account strategies based on\nlocal indigenous initiatives;\n(2) Provide technical and financial assistance for capacity-building programmes to support\nsustainable self-development of indigenous peoples and their communities;\n(3) Strengthen research and education programmes aimed at:\n(a) achieving a better understanding of indigenous peoples knowledge and management\nexperience related to the environment and applying this to contemporary development\nchallenges;\n(b) increasing the efficiency of indigenous people\u2019s resource management systems, for\nexample, by promoting the adaptation and dissemination of suitable technological\ninnovations.\nChapter 26 of Agenda 21 contributes meaningfully to the cause of indigenous peoples and gives\nimpetus to the United Nations to address problems in a more energetic and committed manner. The\nDeclaration of the International Decade for Indigenous Peoples provided the time frame for defining\ntargets and measuring performance and achievements.\nA Resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, launched the International Decade of\nthe World\u2019s Indigenous People. The Resolution states that:\nOne of the purposes of the United Nations, as set out in its charter, is the achievement of\ninternational cooperation in solving international problems. Whether these problems are\neconomic, social, cultural or humanitarian in character, the United Nation\u2019s role is to promote\nand encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. The relevant\nrecommendations of the World Conference on Human Rights, the United Nations Conference\non Environment and Development and the International Conference on Population and\nDevelopment, in particular Chapter 26 of Agenda 21, recognise and strengthen the role of\nindigenous peoples and their communities. The General Assembly of the United Nations, has\ndetermined to promote the enjoyment of the rights of indigenous people and the full\ndevelopment of their distinct culture and communities.3\nOther significant international documents to become acquainted with include the United Nations draft\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the World Conference on Human Rights, held in\nVienna in June 1993, and the Secretary General\u2019s reports regarding the United Nation\u2019s Agendas for\nPeace, Development and International Economic Cooperation. All of these documents form the\ninternational legal and policy foundations upon which indigenous peoples from around the world can\ndevelop their sustainable development strategies.\n3. United Nations Resolution, December 23, 1993\n190\n\nThe Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 may be one of the United Nation\u2019s most significant\nachievements for its 50th Year Anniversary. It succeeded in assembling the largest number of heads of\nstate ever to consider the problems facing the Earth as a whole, and to adopt measures where the parts\nwould operate in the service of the whole\u2014the way nature does\u2014and promote a future that is\nprosperous, equitable and sustainable. In a consensus unique in the annals of international relations, the\nleaders were able to agree on a new plan of action, Agenda 21, a global blueprint designed to move\nhumanity through a macro-transition towards the 21st century.\nUpon their return home from the Earth Summit, the Grand Council of the Haudenosaunee convened a\nGrand Council to discuss environmental degradation in their own communities. The Grand Council\nestablished, in accordance with the Haudenosaunee Great Law of Peace and based on Haudenosaunee\ncultural beliefs and protocols, the Haudenosaunee Environmental Task Force. This Task Force is\ncomposed of delegates chosen by each of the Haudenosaunee Nations. These Nation community\nmembers represent all walks of life, from Clanmothers and Chiefs to midwives, technicians and\nscientists, all interested in environmental and cultural protection.\nThe Haudenosaunee Environmental Task Force launched one of the first comprehensive responses to\nthe United Nations: a sustainable development strategy to initiate the International Decade of the\nWorld\u2019s Indigenous Peoples. In March 1994, Haudenosaunee leaders submitted a request to the\nSecretary General of the United Nations, and asked the Director of the United Nations Environment\nProgramme for assistance. A subsequent partnership was formed between the Haudenosaunee and the\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\nA United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Working Committee was formed, serving as an ad\nhoc group convened for the purposes of advising the Haudenosaunee Environmental Task Force on the\ndevelopment of the comprehensive action Strategy. The Working Committee consisted on the UNEP\nDirector and Programme staffer, two members of Indigenous Development International (located in\nCambridge, England), a former Ambassador to Jamaica, a Chief of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy\nand myself, working at that time outside of my official capacity as an Assistant Regional Counsel for\nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nUNEP\u2019s Working Committee oversaw the work of myself, as principal author, who, under the direction\nof the Haudenosaunee Environmental Task Force, undertook to compile a comprehensive document on\nHaudenosaunee environmental deterioration. At the invitation of UNEP, this document was reviewed\nand published in partnership by Indigenous Development International, a United Nations/University of\nCambridge Partnership Programme. This document is entitled: Haudenosaunee Environmental\nRestoration Strategy: An Indigenous Strategy for Human Sustainability, and is hereinafter referred to as\nthe Haudenosaunee Environmental Restoration Strategy.\nThis successful international partnership between the Haudenosaunee People and the UNEP resulted in\nan indigenous environmental Summit of the Elders, held at the United Nations on the 18th of July 1995,\nduring which the Haudenosaunee Environmental Restoration Strategy was presented to the\nUnited Nations. The Haudenosaunee Environmental Restoration Strategy constitutes one of the first\ncomprehensive indigenous responses to Chapter 26 of Agenda 21 formulated at the 1992 Rio Earth\nSummit.\nUNEP expressed its hope that the Summit of the Elders serves to convince the Haudenosaunee and all\nindigenous peoples of its concern and willingness to be supportive of actions that will facilitate the\nrestoration and rehabilitation of indigenous territories. In keeping with the spirit of Agenda 21, the\nUnited Nations wants to build confidence in the United Nations and its systems of agencies.\nEven before the Summit, the United Nations Environment Programme has been assisting efforts and\ninitiatives of indigenous peoples. UNEP provides additional channels of access to the organisation and\nits various programmes of action, and supports efforts to participate in UN activities, such as the\nCharter for Nature and the World Conservation Strategies. Since its inception, UNEP has recognised\nthat indigenous peoples are natural allies, and that most indigenous cultures are based on a profound\nrespect for nature. Indigenous consumption patterns and lifestyles are premised on the principle of\nsustainability\u2014a philosophy all indigenous cultures share\u2014to not pick the first of a species that you\nsee, take no more than you need and give thanks for what you take.\n191\n\nThroughout the years, UNEP has found common cause with indigenous peoples from around the world.\nDuring the Rio Summit, UNEP supported a number of indigenous gatherings and even funded the\nparticipation of several to the Rio Conference.\nThe leaders of the Haudenosaunee were encouraged to undertake their environmental restoration\nstrategy as a result of the Earth Summit and UNEP\u2019s support. The Rio Earth Summit fully\nacknowledged the contributions indigenous peoples can make to the concept of sustainability based on\ntheir harmonious relationship with the natural order and their holistic traditional, scientific knowledge\nof the land and natural resources which they have developed over many generations. This knowledge-\nbased system is often referred to as indigenous traditional knowledge.\nAt the same time, Haudenosaunee leaders welcomed the assertion by Earth Summit leaders that in\nmany instances, indigenous communities are not able to participate fully in decisions that affect them.\nWorld leaders called for action\u2014for full partnership with governments and international organisations\nin the establishment of procedures that will empower indigenous peoples and their communities in\norder to protect them from activities that are environmentally unsound or socially and culturally\ninappropriate.\nIn the post-Rio phase, the United Nations Environment Programme began exploring the most effective\nways it might give meaning to Chapter 26 of Agenda 21, and assist in the work of indigenous peoples.\nIt did this in two ways. First, UNEP created a new extension programme in cooperation with the\nUniversity of Cambridge called Indigenous Development International (INDI); this allowed a global\noverview to be developed on the relationships of indigenous peoples to existing nation-states\u2014\nspecifically to the political, economic and environmental dimensions. Second, it responded to the\nspecific appeal made by the Haudenosaunee Confederacy to assist in the exploration of environmental\nhazards in their territories with the intent of formulating a strategy for the restoration of nation lands. In\nthe process, UNEP encourages indigenous peoples to identify for themselves, crucial issues, evaluate\nthese on the basis of available science and research, and formulate a plan of action which UNEP will\nconsider and assist in its implementation. The result was the Summit of the Elders whereby the plan\nwas considered and the case of the Haudenosaunee was given the best possible hearing.\nThe Summit of the Elders was a combination of several months of intense work, both by UNEP and the\nHaudenosaunee Environmental Task Force. The Haudenosaunee Environmental Task Force invited me,\nas the principle investigator, to undertake the work. We reviewed the range of environmental hazards to\nwhich communities have been exposed, documented as precisely as possible the sources and nature of\nthese hazards, and designed a plan of action for the remediation and environmental restoration of the\nterritories in question. We reviewed and included some of the most comprehensive studies done to date\non chemical pollutants, genetics and the human genome work, the nuclear waste question and\ninternational rights, conventions and the law. We also dovetailed environmental appraisals of\nindigenous communities.\nWhat we learn from this particular process and the Haudenosaunee Environmental Restoration Strategy\nare the following things:\n(1) that indigenous rights should be interpreted in the framework of not just court litigation or\nconventional law, but the common law of charters and constitutions;\n(2) that sustainable development strategies are not formula driven or generic but quite particular\nand context/culture specific;\n(3) that indigenous peoples seek and assert their identity on the basis of territories and lands in a\nspirit of respect rather than by property control or ownership;\n(4) that restoration plans are long-term, capacity-building exercises, including training and\neducation as well as clean-up and they are costly; and\n(5) that acting locally means thinking globally, publicly, and above all, compassionately.\nThe Haudenosaunee Environmental Restoration Strategy continues the message of the Haudenosaunee\nPeacemaker to recognise the rights of the children of the world\u2014the \u2018unborn generations\u2019. The\nPeacemaker of the Haudenosaunee reminded its leaders to think not only of their communities, or even\ntheir own generation, but to think of continuing generations of families, grandchildren and those yet\n192\n\nunborn, whose faces are coming from beneath the ground. I believe the world would do well to adopt\nthe Haudenosaunee belief that all decisions must be made with the Seventh Generation in mind.\nHow do we incorporate this indigenous reverence for the natural world and natural law, especially in\ntimes such as these, with serious fiscal restraints? Back when the Haudenosaunee Environmental\nRestoration Strategy was presented to EPA for implementation, EPA was threatened with a 34% budget\ncut for the fiscal year of 1996. With these thoughts in mind, we identified in the Haudenosaunee\nEnvironmental Restoration Strategy, the most critical need in the implementation of the restoration\nplan, namely the requirement for a new kind of \u2018coalition politics\u2019 or partnership between governments,\nindigenous nations and the United Nations. Ten years later, the fiscal outlook is conservative. EPA was\ncut 20% last year and is threatened with another 20% budget cut for the fiscal year of 2006. The agency\nis now designing a plan to try and prevent the budget cuts from going too deep. Due to the enormous\ncost of the Iraq war, the need for fiscal conservancy at this time makes it even more crucial that we\nbegin to understand the need to form our own cooperative relationships with those responsible for the\ntransboundary pollution which impacts indigenous territories, with a bright light shining from the\ninternational community.\nI repeat the need for us all to reassess our point of view to favor a new kind of \u2018coalition politics\u2019 or\npartnership between governments, indigenous nations and the United Nations. Governments do not\nhave enormous sums of money, but they do have political clout. I encourage all indigenous\ncommunities to re-examine nation-state executive and legislative actions to glean commitments to\npreserve and protect the environment and indigenous cultures. If they do not presently exist, create\nthem, using existing models and frameworks. For example, in the United States, President Clinton\u2019s\nExecutive Order to address Environmental Justice in Minority and Low-Income Populations is an\nimportant source of U.S. policy regarding Native Americans. The Environmental Justice Executive\nOrder requires the executive departments of the United States federal government, including the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA), to identify and address disproportionately high and adverse\nhuman health or environmental effects of its programs, policies and activities on minority and low-\nincome populations. It specifically includes tribal governments, requiring the government to share\nexisting data and work cooperatively with tribal governments. EPA\u2019s website notes that:\nIn response to public concerns, EPA created the Office of Environmental Justice in 1992, and\nimplemented a new organisational infrastructure to integrate environmental justice into EPA's\npolicies, programs, and activities. An Executive Steering Committee made up of senior\nmanagers represents each headquarters office and region. It provides leadership and direction\non strategic planning to ensure that environmental justice is incorporated into agency\noperations; the most active group is the Environmental Justice Coordinators Council which\nserves as the frontline staff specifically responsible to ensure policy input, program\ndevelopment, and implementation of environmental justice through the Agency. This new\nstructure has established a clear commitment from EPA's senior management to all personnel\nthat Environmental Justice is a priority.4\nA National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC) was formed, which serves as a federal\nadvisory committee established to provide independent advice, consultation, and recommendations to\nthe Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on matters related to environmental\njustice. The NEJAC was established on the 30th of September, 1993. The functions of the NEJAC\ncannot be performed within the Agency. This council is the first time that community, academia,\nindustry, environmental, indigenous, and state/local/tribal government groups have been brought\ntogether where a dialogue can define how to \"reinvent\" solutions to environmental justice problems. It\nis essential that such a dialogue occur. In addition, NEJAC provides a valuable forum for integrating\nenvironmental justice with other EPA priorities and initiatives.\nThe NEJAC is made up of 26 members, and one Designated Federal Officer (DFO), who serve on a\nparent council that has seven subcommittees. Along with the NEJAC members who fill subcommittee\nposts, an additional 27 individuals serve on the various subcommittees. Each subcommittee, formed to\ndeal with a specific topic and to facilitate the conduct of the business of NEJAC, has a DFO and is\n4. www.epa.gov. Specific site: http://www.epa.gov/compliance/environmentaljustice/nejac/overview.html.\n193\n\nbound by the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) of October the 16th, 1972.\nSubcommittees of the NEJAC meet independently of the full NEJAC and present their findings to the\nNEJAC for review. Subcommittees cannot make recommendations independently to EPA. In addition\nto the seven subcommittees, NEJAC has established a Protocol Committee, the members of which are\nthe chair of NEJAC and the chairs of each subcommittee. There is a NEJAC Indigenous Subcommittee\nwhich has been created:\nTo provide independent advice to the Executive Council of the NEJAC and, through the\nCouncil, to EPA in areas related to indigenous peoples. To achieve its mission, the\nSubcommittee will, at a minimum, perform the following functions:\n1) Provide a forum for representatives of indigenous communities, including grassroots\norganisations from within those communities, to bring their environmental justice concerns\nto the attention of the NEJAC and provide recommendations and advice to the NEJAC to\naddress those concerns.\n2) Provide recommendations and advice to the NEJAC on the development of EPA-backed\nlegislation, as well as Agency policy, guidance, and protocol, to help achieve environmental\njustice for indigenous peoples.\n3) Provide recommendations and advice to the NEJAC to ensure that environmental justice\nissues of concern to indigenous peoples are addressed by EPA in a manner that fulfills the\ntrust responsibility, respects tribal sovereignty and the government-to-government\nrelationship, upholds treaties, and promotes tribal self-determination.\n4) Recognise that issues facing indigenous peoples span the spectrum of issues addressed by\nother NEJAC subcommittees and interface with those subcommittees to ensure that all\nsubcommittees address environmental justice issues of concern to indigenous peoples in an\ninformed manner.5\nAmong the first recommendations advocated by the NEJAC Indigenous Subcommittee were:\n1) that the Agency create an American Indian Environmental Office in EPA, Headquarters; and\n2) that the American Indian Office work to enhance government-to-government relations with\nIndian Nations across the U.S.\nTo its credit, EPA senior managers took these recommendations very seriously and implemented them\nboth. In February 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established a Tribal\nOperations Committee in order to improve communication and build stronger partnerships with the\nIndian Nations across the United States. EPA\u2019s Tribal Operations Committee (TOC) is comprised of 19\nTribal leaders or their Environmental Program Managers (referred to as the \"Tribal Caucus\") and EPA's\nSenior Leadership Team, including the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator and the Agency's\nAssistant Administrators and Regional Administrators. The Tribal Caucus (TC) meets on a regular basis\nto discuss implementation of the environmental protection programs for which EPA and the\nIndian Nations share responsibility as co-regulators.\nIn 1994, EPA also created the American Indian Environmental Office, at EPA Headquarters in\nWashington, DC. Mr. Terry Williams, a member of the Tulalip Nation in the State of Washington\nserved as the first Director of the AIEO. Mr. Williams promptly issued an Action Directive to each of\nEPA\u2019s ten regional offices. The Action Directive requires each region to develop, together with the\nNative people in its Region, a long term indigenous environmental plan, which prioritises the needs and\nconcerns as voiced by the folks who live and work in the affected communities of indigenous territories.\nWe, through the Haudenosaunee Environmental Restoration Strategy, have documented the\nenvironmental conditions and impacts in Region 2 Haudenosaunee communities. We have completed\nthe first step.\nThe United Nations\u2019 Summit of the Elders was an important second step. UNEP\u2019s Summit of the Elders\nfor the Haudenosaunee redoubled the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s commitment to review\n5. www.epa.gov. Specific site:\nhttp://www.epa.gov/compliance/environmentaljustice/nejac/indigenous_subcommittee.html.\n194\n\nthe Haudenosaunee Environmental Restoration Strategy in an attempt to find sources of funding to\nrestore the environment. Arguably, United States law and policy supports a strong federal presence and\ncommitment to enforce the federal government\u2019s trust responsibility pursuant to existing treaties.\nA particular way we asked EPA to be responsive, was to review the Haudenosaunee Environmental\nRestoration Strategy in light of EPA\u2019s own policies, directives and mandates, especially those issued\nout of the newly created American Indian Environmental Office, at EPA Headquarters in Washington,\nDC. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reviewed the Strategy to see what it could commit to.\nWe breathed life into EPA\u2019s Policy on Environmental Programs on Indian Reservations. This EPA\nIndian Policy was issued during President Reagan\u2019s administration, in 1984, together with\nimplementation guidance.\nEPA\u2019s Indian Policy documents emphasise EPA\u2019s commitment to work directly with Native\ngovernments on a \u2018government-to-government\u2019 basis:\nThe President published a federal Indian policy on January the 24th, 1983, supporting the\nprimary role of tribal governments in matters affecting American Indian reservations. That\npolicy stressed two related themes: (l) that the federal government will pursue the principle of\nIndian \"self-government\" and (2) that it will work directly with tribal governments on a\n\"government-to-government\" basis.\nIn carrying out our responsibilities on Indian reservations, the fundamental objective of the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency is to protect human health and the environment. The keynote\nof this effort will be to give special consideration to tribal interests in making agency policy,\nand to insure the close involvement of Tribal Governments in making decisions and managing\nenvironmental programs affecting reservation lands. To meet this objective, the Agency will\npursue the following principles:\n1) The Agency stands ready to work directly with Indian tribal governments on a one-to-one\nbasis (the \"Government-to-government\" relationship), rather than as subdivisions of other\ngovernments.\n2) The Agency will recognise tribal governments as the primary parties for setting standards,\nmaking environmental policy decisions and managing programs for reservations,\nconsistent with agency standards and regulations.\n3) The Agency will take affirmative steps to encourage and assist tribes in assuming\nregulatory and program management responsibilities for reservation lands.\n4) The Agency will take appropriate steps to remove existing legal and procedural\nimpediments to working directly and effectively with tribal governments on reservation\nprograms.\n5) The Agency, in keeping with the federal trust responsibility, will assure that tribal\nconcerns and interests are considered whenever EPA's actions and/or decisions may affect\nreservation environments.\n6) The Agency will encourage cooperation between tribal, state and local governments to\nresolve environmental problems of mutual concern.\n7) The Agency will work with other federal agencies which have related responsibilities on\nIndian reservations to enlist their interest and support in cooperative efforts to help tribes\nassume environmental program responsibilities for reservations.\n8) The Agency will strive to assure compliance with environmental statutes and regulations\non Indian reservations.\n9) The Agency will incorporate these Indian policy goals into its planning and management\nactivities including its budget, operating guidance, legislative initiatives, management\naccountability system and ongoing policy and regulation development processes.6\nWorking together with EPA Region 2 over the last ten years, we have worked to craft a long-term\nimplementation plan, negotiated between the Haudenosaunee people and EPA, with my facilitation. On\nbehalf of the Haudenosaunee, the Haudenosaunee Environmental Task Force (HETF) has been\nextremely active in designing and developing its own capacity to implement environmental programs\n6.

The HETF has developed an environmental\npresence in each community, and some Nations now have an Environmental Department with a\nDirector and staff working in areas of concern (such as air, water, solid waste, pollution prevention,\nenvironmental education).\nThe Haudenosaunee Environmental Task Force Mission\nThe mission of the Haudenosaunee Environmental Task Force (HETF) is to help\nHaudenosaunee Nations in their efforts to conserve, preserve, protect, and restore their\nenvironmental, natural, and cultural resources; to promote the health and survival of the sacred\nweb of life for future generations; to support other indigenous nations working on\nenvironmental issues; and to fulfill our responsibilities to the natural world as our Creator\ninstructed without jeopardising peace, sovereignty, or treaty obligations. However, as\nindigenous nations, we realise that all things are interconnected and do not wish to limit our\nactivities to those listed above.7\nHaudenosaunee Environmental Task Force Goals8\nTo implement strategies that will restore and strengthen environmental and community health;\nTo improve communications within and between Haudenosaunee communities;\nTo inform Haudenosaunee people about pollution issues and promote local pollution prevention\nactivities;\nTo support and encourage community based environmental education;\nTo develop culturally appropriate educational curricula for Haudenosaunee youth;\nTo enhance the skills of the Haudenosaunee to conduct scientific research, including sampling\nand testing for toxic chemicals; and;\nTo develop culturally-based environmental protection processes.\nThe Haudenosaunee remain leaders on initiatives with national and international significance, including\nthe incorporation of indigenous traditional knowledge into environmental problem-solving,\ndevelopment of culturally based environmental protection processes and a Haudenosaunee Whole\nHealth Initiative.\nIn 1999, the HETF published the book Words That Come Before All Else: Environmental Philosophies\nof the Haudenosaunee:\nThis 160-page book draws from the Thanksgiving Address and Haudenosaunee Creation Story\nto present a traditional outlook on Haudenosaunee relationship with the natural world.\nInterwoven in the book are practical examples of how the Haudenosaunee are trying to\nincorporate traditional knowledge in addressing modern day environmental problems.9\nThe Haudenosaunee Environmental Task Force is [also] proceeding with a project to develop\nan environmental protection process based on our indigenous world view and relationship with\nthe natural world. Such an environmental protection process will enable the individual nations\nand communities of the Haudenosaunee to protect and restore the natural world, while helping\nto preserve our unique relationship with it, as a sustainable society. We contend this to be the\nbest way to promote our sovereignty in a way most consistent with our culture. At the same\ntime, we propose to bring out the Silver Covenant Chain and polish it so that this project is\ndone cooperatively within the context of the complexities of contemporary society. In other\nwords, we recognise the need for our environmental protection process to incorporate our\ntraditional knowledge and laws to maintain our sovereignty and protect our culture. At the same\ntime, if we ever need the ship (in the guise of the federal government) to help us protect the\nriver, we must demonstrate that our process meets or exceeds the requirements of federal\nenvironmental laws.10\n7.

(see Home Page).\n196\n\nFinally, the Whole Health Initiative: \u201cSome things will always need to remain the same because\nwe still live on the same Mother Earth that our ancestors lived. The basic patterns of nature\nhave not changed. We still live in the same areas as our ancestors, so we understand how nature\nworks in our territories. The Original Instructions that we received still apply to our lives. We\nare to keep the basic traditions of Thanksgiving alive. Yet, we must recognise that the life in\nour communities has changed dramatically over the generations. Change is inevitable, but our\nculture is a mechanism that can be used to make sure that the changes are not detrimental to the\nsocial, ceremonial, economic, educational, and political life of our communities, now and the\nfuture.\u201d11\nThese processes are developing a framework which can be utilised by indigenous peoples around the\nworld. The efforts of the Haudenosaunee have been examined by many other indigenous peoples.\nFaithkeeper Oren Lyons and I have traveled as far as Sapmiland, at the request of the indigenous\npeoples there, to assist the Sapmi and the Swedish government in understanding how to develop a\nworking relationship to preserve the environment. I offered technical assistance in developing a process\nto build a relationship between the Swedish government and the Sapmi to address significant\nenvironmental problems, and recommended such a relationship be patterned after the successful\nrelationship established between USEPA and the Haudenosaunee. In fact, the United Nations has stated\nthat the Haudenosaunee project will serve as the United Nations\u2019 framework of how it interacts with\nindigenous peoples around the world. At the UN Summit of the Elders, Chief Oren Lyons, Faithkeeper\nand a Spiritual Leader of the Haudenosaunee, closed with these words:\n\u201cThis is why we come to the United Nations, asking for the support of the United Nation\u2019s\norganisations as well as industry, who we know we must work with, come to terms with and\ncome to peace with. Appreciation and respect must be observed for Native people. It is a dark\nhour and we turn to the United Nations for help. But we know as a people that we must do this\nfor ourselves and for the Seventh Generation. Our knowledge systems can be used to save the\nworld. Scientists know process, we know the natural law. The key to sustainable development\nis environmentally-friendly businesses. We have already worked with industry to come up with\na sustainable forestry plan for our territories. We can be leaders in developing environmental\nsustainability.\nThe United Nations is at a turning point\u2014it is fifty years old this year. The direction that the\nUnited Nations takes will determine the fate of the global family. The UN needs to be more\nopen to the Non Governmental Organisations of the world\u2014for the benefit of the world. Unless\nhuman beings begin to understand what is occurring, and unless human beings speak, we are in\nfor a very rough future. There is no one speaking for the human beings. We are here to speak\nfor the human beings. The world will benefit by appreciating and respecting Native peoples and\ntheir culture. Ours is a common cause for all\u2014because surrounding our territories are the\nnations of the United States and Canada and they will benefit by clean air and clean water- they\nwill benefit from our example.\u201d\nIn closing, I leave you with the challenge placed at the feet of this generation. It is time for all good\nminds to gather and raise our voices to speak out and save our Mother, the Earth.\nThis document was written by Janice Whitney Annunziata in her private capacity.

Ivers (2001) in her publication, \u2018indigenous Australians and Tobacco:\nA literature review,\u2019 reveals an almost complete lack of research and evaluation in the area of tobacco\ncontrol measures. What is obvious from research within the non-indigenous population is the need for\nmulti-strategy interventions that target not just the individual but also the community within which they\nlive. Individuals will be more likely to succeed in modifying their smoking behaviour if their social and\nphysical environments support their attempts. Any intervention therefore needs to address not just\nindividual attitudes and resources but also the knowledge, attitudes and resources available at a\ncommunity level.\nThe effect of indigenous peoples' history on their health must be acknowledged (National Health and\nMedical Research Council, 1996). Sibthorpe (1988) and Flick (1998) have specifically linked high\nlevels of tobacco use with the dispossession and loss resulting from colonisation. Many indigenous\npeople were not paid in wages until 1967, being paid instead in rations in the form of flour, clothes and\ntobacco. Ivers (2001) maintains that many current smokers in their 50s and 60s may have initially\nacquired their addiction at a time when they were paid in tobacco.\nPrevalence and patterns of tobacco use in contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander society\nThe use of tobacco is a major cause of premature mortality and morbidity among indigenous peoples\u2019\nof Australia (Ivers, 2001). The National Drug Strategy Household Survey (2001) reported that a higher\nproportion of indigenous Australians smoked compared with non-indigenous Australians, and the\naverage number of cigarettes smoked per week was also higher (125.4 and 108.3 respectively). The\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Survey (1994) states that\n54% of males and 46% of females aged 13 years or more were smokers. As with the general population,\nthe prevalence of smoking among indigenous women is generally lower than among indigenous men.\nThe prevalence of tobacco use amongst indigenous people in the Top End of the NT is 70\u201380 per cent\n(Ivers, 2001), and the life expectancy of indigenous people between 1992 and 1994 was 15\u201320 years\nless than that of the general population (McLennan & Madden, 1997).\nPatterns of smoking among indigenous people may differ from those among non-indigenous\nAustralians. Watson, Fleming and Alexander (1988) survey of indigenous people in the Northern\nTerritory found that adults shared tobacco and cigarettes with others and also shared individual\ncigarettes. Tobacco use patterns varied according to the amount of tobacco available, with people\nconsuming tobacco heavily in the first few days after receiving pay and then little towards the end of\nthe pay fortnight. Altman (1987) reported that sharing of tobacco was extensive in Western Arnhem\nLand and the extent depended on the degree to which goods were in surplus or absent. In Gilchrist's\n(1998) survey of indigenous women presenting to an Aboriginal Medical Service in Perth, women\nreported an expectation that a smoker who had no cigarettes would be given cigarettes, and that\nsomeone who had cigarettes had an obligation to share them. The high prevalence of tobacco use\namong indigenous people indicates that there is a need for interventions to reduce the prevalence of\ntobacco use is this population.\n199\n\nDevelopment of strategies\nOver a four year period Queensland Health in partnership with key organisations has developed a suite\nof strategies to address tobacco smoking at a number of levels.\nThese include:\n\u2022\nEvent support program: \u2013 \u2018ESP\u2019 is a community based program aimed at increasing levels of\ncommunity awareness with an anti-tobacco message. Community groups can apply for\nfunding and/or merchandise to be incorporated into cultural and sporting events.\n\u2022\nBrief intervention: \u2013 \u2018SmokeCheck\u2019 was designed to enable health practitioners to advise and\nassist clients in techniques to modify smoking behaviour. Modules include information about\nbehaviour change, cessations methods, developing support systems, the health effects of\nsmoking and cigarette components.\n\u2022\nGroup intervention: \u2013 \u2018Smoke Rings\u2019 is an awareness program that supports individuals\ncontemplating or actively changing their smoking behaviour. It encourages participants to\ndevelop support systems and provides information about cessation methods.\n\u2022\nSchool based smoking awareness program: \u2013 \u2018Smokin\u2019 No Way\u2019 is a classroom based\nprogram delivering education about the effects and health risks associated with smoking.\nTeachers and Community Education Counsellors undertake a training session that\ncompliments the Health and Physical Education curriculum.\n\u2022\nWork-place smoke-free policy: \u2013 provides practical application to develop and implement a\nsmoke-free workplace. A workshop is conducted with a guide for developing policy is\nprovided to assist organisations to achieve smokefree status.\n\u2022\nMonitoring of legislation: \u2013 the Tobacco and other Smoking Products Act (2001).\nEnvironmental Health Officers visit communities, undertake tobacco compliance audits and\nensure that there is adherence to current legislation.\nDuring the development and implementation stage of resource development stakeholders were\nidentified who were most appropriate to provide input into each strategy. Government and non-\ngovernment organisations that collaborated to produce relevant resources included: Queensland Health,\nQueensland Education, Catholic Education, Sport and Recreation, community controlled health\nservices, and state and territory health departments.\nIndigenous Tobacco Project\nThe North Queensland Indigenous Tobacco Project, funded by the National Health and Medical\nResearch Council, is a three year collaborative research project between James Cook University,\nQueensland Health and eight indigenous communities. The project is a multi-intervention approach that\ntargets individuals as well as their communities and is intended to address knowledge, attitudes and\nresources related to tobacco use.\nThe project has three broad aims;\nTo increase the capacity of health services to implement and deliver anti-tobacco interventions.\nTo increase community knowledge about the health risks of smoking.\nTo decrease the level of tobacco consumption within communities.\nHousehold Survey Process\nThroughout the project three household surveys will be conducted with the first one completed over the\nsummer of 2004, and the midline survey just completed in the eight communities. Key individuals and\norganisations within communities were approached to identify relevant community members to\nundertake survey work and flyers were put onto noticeboards advertising the survey positions.\nInterested community members were provided with an overview of the project and the role of the\nsurvey staff. If people were interested in undertaking the survey work then they received training in the\ndata collection tool and practised the questionnaire with the research team. In the eight communities, 22\nlocal people were employed and they received Research Officer wages for the length of data collection\nand merchandise from the Event Support Program.\n200\n\nHousehold surveys will inform a major part of the project evaluation and face-to-face interviews with\ntwo adults from every household are required. The survey was adapted from the National Drug Survey\nin Australia in 1994 and 1998 and minor changes were made to language. The questionnaire took\nbetween 5\u201315 minutes for non-smokers and up to 30 minutes for smokers. Community Councils\nsupplied maps identifying dwellings within their community and each research staff member identified\nan area that they would survey with household numbers allocated. In some communities due to clan\nconnections research staff would discuss with research team members the household they could not\napproach or households they felt comfortable to interview. Research staff were encouraged to use local\nlanguage when asking questions and both Aboriginal English and Torres Strait Islander Creole was\napplied.\nDiscussion\u2014indigenous researchers\nFour members of the seven person project are Aboriginal, one of the three is an Associate Investigator\non the project grant, and the other three manage, coordinate and undertake field research. Established\nnetworks and relationships in many of the communities facilitated an easier process for project\nengagement. Two of the researchers had previously worked on projects with most of the involved\ncommunities and had reputable \u2018track records\u2019. Whilst it may be difficult to validate that community\nengagement and involvement is directly linked to established relationships with individuals from the\nresearch team, it would be true to say that personal integrity, previous successful work projects and\nbeing acknowledged as being Aboriginal most certainly assists the process.\nCommunity involvement\nSurvey staff was asked if they were interested in undertaking any form of study within either a\nuniversity or TAFE institution. Information about courses was supplied by research team members and\none young indigenous woman proceeded to enrol in a Tertiary Access Course at James Cook\nUniversity. The research team has supported her through her course by ensuring she received a\nthorough orientation to the university campus, assisting her with travel to and from university when\nrequired, providing tutoring, offering to review assignments, providing the use of computer and printing\nresources, and offering her casual employment which suits her university workload. The student plans\nto enrol in a Bachelor of Nursing Degree to commence next year.\nAnother young woman from a remote western community who worked as a research officer has been\nemployed to provide training and support with three of the tobacco interventions in her community, and\nshe has indicated her interest in ongoing employment in the data collection process.\nThe sustainability of strategies in communities requires the participation of community members to\nensure there is local ownership, understanding and input into the research project. Transparent and\nregular communication with Aboriginal Community Councils and key organisations is vital to ensure\nongoing access to the community, project support and research direction.\nBibliography\nAltman, J.

The\nterm encompasses a broad range of indigenous knowledge ranging from: ancient stories, songs and\ndances; traditional architecture and agricultural; biodiversity-related and medicinal, herbal and plant\nknowledge; ancient motifs, crests and other artistic designs; various artistic mediums, styles, forms and\ntechniques; spiritual and religious institutions and their symbols; and various other forms of indigenous\nknowledge.\nPrior to the 1980s, predominant Western perspectives tended to view traditional knowledge (TK) as\nrelatively insignificant for the industrialised world and commonly referred to it as \u201cfolklore.\u201d In the\n1980s, ownership of knowledge and artistic creations traceable to the world\u2019s indigenous societies\nemerged, seemingly out of nowhere, as a major social (and economic and trade) issue. (1) The market\nvalue of plant-based medicines alone (most of which were first used by indigenous peoples) sold in\ndeveloped countries amounted to $43 billion in 1985 (Principe, 1989). Throughout the 1990s and into\nthe 21st century it has become increasingly apparent that TK not only has immense economic value, but\nalso salient intrinsic value that contains: cures to diseases and ailments; sustainable management of\nresources and ecosystems; means to spiritual healing, healthy lifestyle alternatives; and aesthetics,\nforms and techniques that produce some of the worlds greatest artworks.\nThe primary purposes of this paper are: 1) to outline and establish principles in the use of TK in\ncontemporary artworks (and other tangible commercial objects); 2) to establish theoretical frameworks\non indigenous artists' transformation of TK through their practice; and, 3) to develop useful models and\nconcepts to regulate the use of TK in the contemporary artistic context (and other tangible commercial\nobjects). This will be achieved by first outlining the development of systems of regulating creative\nworks in indigenous nations and European nations. Related concepts and principles developed through\ncommon law in Canada and Australia will also be discussed with regard to their relevance to the\nestablishment of TK regulation. An analysis of the practices and works of one particular indigenous\nartist, Bill Reid, will also be analysed to illustrate how concepts from indigenous and European Laws\ncan be fused in concepts regulating the use and transformation of TK through the contemporary arts.\nDevelopment of parallel indigenous and European traditional knowledge systems\nIndigenous peoples have numerous internal customary laws associated with the use of TK. These\ncultural protocols are part of the laws that indigenous nations have been governed by for millennia and\nare primarily contained in the oral tradition. Although, in lieu of the increased outside interest in TK\nand problems with interaction between TK and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) systems, there is a\ncurrent movement among indigenous nations to document their protocols in written and/or digital\nformat. Cultural protocols around the use of TK vary greatly between indigenous nations, but include\nsuch regulations whereby:\n\u2022 certain songs, dances, stories and dramatic performances can only be performed/recited by\ncertain individuals, families or clan members in certain settings and/or certain seasons and/or\nfor certain indigenous internal cultural reasons;\n\u2022 crests, motifs, designs and symbols are owned by certain individuals, families or clan\nmembers;\n\u2022 artistic aspects of TK, such as songs, dances, stories dramatic performances can only be\nshared in certain settings or spiritual ceremonies with individuals who have earned, inherited\nand/or gone through a cultural and/or educational process\n203\n\n\u2022 art forms and techniques can not be practiced, and/or certain motifs can not be used, until the\nemerging artist has apprenticed under a master artist;\n\u2022 certain ceremonial art can only be shared for specific internal indigenous cultural and/or\nspiritual reasons and within specific indigenous cultural contexts.\nThese are but a few general examples of customary laws that indigenous nations around the world have\ndeveloped over thousands years to regulate the use of TK. Indigenous protocols are intimately\nintertwined and connected with TK and form what can be viewed as whole and complete, integrated,\ncomplex, indigenous knowledge systems throughout the world. IPR System: The first European notions\nof protection of created works can be traced back to fifteenth century. In 1545 the Venetian Council of\nTen demanded that booksellers secure written proof that publications had received the authors consent\n(Taylor, Crean and Young-Ing). Notions of copyright, as we know it today, date back to the 1710 in\nwhich The Statute of Anne in England required all books to be registered with the Company of\nStationers. The Statute also introduced the first concept a time limit on the rights of authors: 21 years\nfor books already on the Stationer\u2019s Register and up to 28 years for new books.\nIn 18th century France, the concept of droit moral (moral rights) was introduced which in turn lead to\nthe concept droit d\u2019auteur (authors rights). Droit moral theory holds that the author/creator is sovereign\nand therefore his/her work is sovereign and must be respected as such. Droit d\u2019auteur holds that the\nrights of the author/creator are natural and inalienable rights and that the author/creator must be\nidentified with and credited for the work. The Berne Convention of 1886 was the first international\nagreement on copyright and had a moral rights clause added in 1928 in Article 6 stating, \u201cIndependently\nof the author\u2019s economic rights\u2026 [t]he author shall have the right to claim ownership of the work and\nobject to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to, the\nsaid work which would be prejudicial to his honour or reputation.\u201d\nEuropean copyright recognition formed the basis of the current concept of IP as it is known today. As\nEuropean societies became increasingly industrialised, it became apparent that copyright alone was not\nsufficient to protect all forms of IP. The Statute of Monopolies of 1624 in the UK spoke of granting\npatents for \u201cany manner of new manufactures.\u201d (2). In the 18th century, European countries in the\nprocess of industrialisation developed the concept of \u201ctrademark\u201d which was later legislated in the form\nof national Trademark Acts. Patent and trademark, along with copyright, now make up the current IPR\nSystem.\nInteraction between traditional knowledge and and intellectual property rights systems\nIn the process of transporting European institutions into various parts of the world occupied by\nindigenous peoples, Eurocentric laws (including the IPR system) have now been imposed upon\nindigenous law (including the TK system). Traditional knowledge raises serious challenges for the\ncurrent IPR system, which some argue is unable to respond to the concerns of the TK holders. The main\nreasons TK often does not fit into the IPR system are: 1) that expressions of TK often cannot qualify for\nprotection because they are too old and are, therefore, supposedly in the public domain; 2) that the\n\u201cauthor\u201d of the material is often not identifiable and there is thus no \u201crights holder\u201d in the usual sense of\nthe term; and, 3) that TK is owned \u201ccollectively\u201d by indigenous groups for cultural claims and not by\nindividuals or corporations for economic claims.\nAnother key problem TK systems now experience is that the IPR system is based on the premise that\nthe author/creator deserves recognition and compensation for his/her work because it is the product of\nhis/her genius, but that all of society must eventually be able to benefit from that genius. Therefore,\naccording to IP theory, the work must eventually enter the public domain (Taylor, Crean and Young-\nIng). This is the primary reasoning for the time period limitations associated copyright, patents and\ntrademarks. The precept that all IP is intended to eventually enter the public domain is another conflict\nbetween the two systems because indigenous protocols dictate that certain aspects of TK are unfit (or, at\nleast, strictly regulated) for external access in any form, including: sacred ceremonial masks, songs and\ndances, various forms of shamanic art, sacred stories, art objects with strong spiritual significance such\nas scrolls, petroglyphs, and decorated staffs, rattles, blankets, medicine bundles and clothing\nadornments, and various sacred symbols, designs, crests and motifs.\n204\n\nIndigenous cultural paradigm\nIndigenous artists have a distinct ethos based on a unique identity that stems from their history, cultures\nand traditions. Indigenous artists also have several responsibilities placed upon them through internal\ncultural imperatives that include portraying reality in a truthful and honest manner and with\nmindfulness of any impact on the community. Through consciousness of indigenous history and\nheritage comes the ultimate responsibility of being the link between ones ancestors and future\ngenerations\u2014a cultural precept that has been referred to by some, such as Native American writer\nLeanne Howe, as the \u201ctime-space continuum.\u201d\nIt is crucial for those attempting to engage with any aspect(s) of indigenous culture to have a clear\nunderstanding of how indigenous peoples perceive and contextualise their traditional and contemporary\ncultural reality. Indigenous societies have undergone attempted genocide, colonisation, and constant\ntechnological revolutions, and the imposition of foreign legal regimes, yet have dealt with the\nimposition of legislation and institutions, and the introduction of new technologies, surviving with the\nfoundations of their unique cultures intact.\nIndigenous peoples have adapted into their various unique and distinct contemporary forms by adhering\nto two important cultural principles: 1) that incorporating new ways of doing things should be carefully\nconsidered in consultation with community and elders and according to customary law; and, 2) if it is\ndetermined that a new technology or institution goes against fundamental cultural values and/or might\nlead to negative cultural impact, or breaches customary law, then it should not be adopted. For their\npart, indigenous artists have adapted their works into various unique and distinct contemporary forms\nby adhering to two important cultural principles: 1) that incorporating TK with new mediums and\ntechnologies should be carefully considered in consultation community and elders, and according to\ncustomary law; and, 2) if it is determined that the use of TK goes against fundamental cultural values\nand/or might lead to negative cultural impact, or constitutes a breech of customary law, then it should\nnot be used.\nIndigenous jurisprudence and law should protect indigenous knowledge. In relation to Eurocentric law,\nindigenous jurisprudence of each heritage should be seen as an issue of conflict of laws and\ncomparative jurisprudence. Indigenous law and protocols should prevail over Eurocentric patent,\ntrademark or copyrights law. In certain cases, consensual conciliation may be reached. (3). It is\npossible, however, to imagine that a fusion of concepts from customary law and IP law could be\ndeveloped to regulate the use of TK in contemporary contexts. In Canada, indigenous jurisprudence,\nknowledge and heritage is uniquely constitutionally protected as Aboriginal or treaty rights in section\n35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and section 25 in the Charter. The Charter also recognises the\nconstitutional and legal rights to Aboriginal heritage (s. 27), languages (s. 22), and education (s. 29).\nThere have also been some significant developments in the area of common law in Canada and\nAustralia that should be examined for their relevance with regard to establishing TK regulations. The\nfollowing section will examine these cases particularly for their disclosures for potential development\nof TK regulation in Canada.\nSnow, Teberge and moral rights\nIn 1931, Canada became the first of the copyright countries to enact a moral rights clause in its\ndomestic legislation. The moral rights clause, Section 12 (5), was adopted by Canadian legislators as a\npreliminary to this country\u2019s ratification of the Berne Convention. In fact, paternity and integrity rights\nof authors of dramatic and operatic works and musical compositions had been recognised by the\nCriminal Code, enacted in 1915 (Section 508B). Furthermore, Quebec\u2019s Theatrical Performance Act,\npassed in 1919, provided for the protection of the moral rights of authors along the lines of the Criminal\nCode\u2019s S. 508B, including penal sanctions for the violation of those rights. Two prominent cases have\nbeen advanced by non-indigenous Canadian artists to test moral rights application to creative works.\nIn 1988, the High Court of Ontario ruled in favour of artist Michael Snow, who brought a suit against\nthe Eaton Centre in Toronto, claiming that his moral rights had been infringed when red Christmas\nribbons were tied around the necks of the flock of Canada geese that form his distinctive sculpture. In\nMarch 2002 the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) issued a decision in the case of Montreal artist Claude\nTh\u00e9berge. The Court was asked to determine the extent to which an artist can control an authorised\n205\n\nreproduction of a work used or displayed by a third party purchaser. The Court ruled against Th\u00e9berge,\nsaying that \u201crespect must be given to the limitations that are an essential part of the moral rights created\nby Parliament\u201d, accusing him of trying \u201cto assert a moral right in the guise of an economic right\u201d\n(Taylor, Crean and Young-Ing).\nThe High Court of Ontario ruling in the Snow Case was a precedent-setting case for the recognition of\nartists\u2019 moral rights in Canada. However, The SCC\u2019s more recent ruling in the Th\u00e9berge case appears to\nhave turned back the trend to recognise artists moral rights in Canadian Law and runs contrary to\nCanada\u2019s obligation under Section 12 (5) of the Berne Convention. moral rights are significant for TK\nholders as it appears to be one of the key points where IP Laws converge with customary laws.\nMoral rights and traditional knowledge\nOther protective mechanisms for IP, besides copyright, patents and trademarks, that have been explored\nwith regard to their potential to protect TK, include: trade secrets, industrial designs, plant breeders\nrights, geographic indicators and certification marks. However, it is not within the scope of this paper to\ngo into those discussions and issues. Of these various European IP and other concepts and regulations\nthat have been applied to TK, and in lieu of the widespread non-indigenous misappropriation of TK,\nmoral rights draws close parallels with what indigenous peoples are seeking for the regulation of TK.\nmoral rights capacity to protect artistic work against \u201cany distortion, mutilation of, or derogatory action\nin relation to the said work which would be prejudicial to honour or reputation\u201d is a concept that is also\nin line with aspects of indigenous customary laws. However, the apparent contradicting messages in the\nSnow and Th\u00e9berge decisions leave moral rights in a state of legal limbo in Canada at the present time.\nProtection for TK under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and section 25 in the Charter appear\nmuch clearer; these clauses, however, remain relatively untested for their capacity to protect TK and all\ntest cases are required to begin this process. Cases in Australia will be discussed in the following\nsection that provides some concrete useful concepts and the beginning of a common law framework for\nTK protection.\nThe Carpets Case\nImported carpets containing direct copies of the artworks of three Aboriginal artists were discovered\ncoming into the Australian market in 1993. Banduk Marika, the only remaining living of the three\nartists, initiated a case against the importer Indofern, who was importing the carpets from a carpet\ncompany based in Vietnam (a country which is not a signatory to the Berne Convention). Marika\u2019s\nwork Djanda and the Sacred Waterhole, one of the images on the carpets, was contained in an\neducational portfolio produced by the National Australian Gallery. In the ensuing investigation\nsurrounding the M* vs. Indofern Case, a copy of the portfolio was found in the Vietnam carpet factory,\nthus establishing the portfolio as the source of the appropriation.\nMarika argued that the image was under the communal ownership of the Rirratjingu Clan and was of\ngreat cultural significance as it forms part of the Rirratjingu creation story. She further explained that\nthe traditional Rirratjingu custodians had granted her permission to paint the image and reproduce the\nportfolio for the purposes of educating people on Aboriginal culture, but not for any commercial use.\nTherefore, the carpets constituted an \u201cUnauthorised Reproduction under customary law.\u201d In addition,\nunder Section 37 of the Copyright Act, it \u201cis an infringement of copyright to import copies of artistic\nworks without the license of the copyright owner for the purposes of sale.\u201d Justice Von Doussa was\nsatisfied that Indofern had constructive knowledge of the infringement in that a \u201creasonable person,\nparticularly one about to engage in the business of selling carpets in Australia\u201d had to have knowledge\nof the facts.\nApart from the copyright infringement recognised in the Case, Justice Von Doussa also allotted\ndamages for \u201cCulturally-Based harm\u201d; however, as moral rights were not introduced in the Copyright\nAct until the Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Act 2000, no specific moral rights implications for\nTK were brought into the case. If moral rights had been in existence at the time the Carpets Case was\nheard, the artists may have had additional claims for infringement of moral rights including: 1)\ninfringement of the right of attribution of authorship; and, 2) infringement of the rights of integrity of\nauthorship in respect of the work. (4)\n206\n\nBulan Bulanbulan vs. Anor R & T Textiles Pty. Ltd.\nThe Aboriginal artist John Bulan Bulan had launched a previous case in 1989 against a T-shirt\nmanufacturer that was settled out of court: however, his 1996 Case against R & T Textiles ended up to\nbe far more significant. In 1996 fabric was discovered on the market in Australia that was derived from\npart of Bulan Bulan\u2019s painting Magpie Geese and Water Lilies at the Waterhole, which depicted part of\nthe Ganalbingu and Yolngu peoples TK. Mr. Bulan Bulan noted that, under Ganalbingu law, ownership\nof land has a corresponding obligation to create artworks, design, songs and other aspect of ritual and\nceremony that go with the land. He argued further that unauthorised reproduction of the artwork\nthreatened the whole system in ways that underpin the stability and continuance of Yolngu society.\n(Jenke, 2003).\nJustice Von Doussa (the same judge as in the Carpet Case) recognised Bulan Bulan as the copyright\nholder of Magpie Geese and Water Lilies at the Waterhole, but did not recognise the claim of joint\nownership (i.e. ownership by Bulan Bulan and the Ganalbingu community) on the grounds that it did\nnot constitute a \u201cwork of joint authorship\u201d under Section 10(1) of the Copyright Act (i.e. a collaboration\nbetween 2 or more authors). Although the Bulan Bulan Case extended copyright protection for TK\nwhere a portion of the original work was copied and altered, it still does not extend that protection to\nTK in a non-material form (Jenke, 2003), nor did it recognise the indigenous group as copyright holders\nin perpetuity. Again, as with the Carpets Case, no significant moral rights issues entered the case as it\nwas also within Australia\u2019s pre-moral rights era.\nThe Legacy of Bill Reid\nAn examination of the legacy of the late Haida Artist, Bill Reid, reveals some useful insights and\nconcepts for TK regulation within the context of the arts. Reid was the grandson of Haida artist Charles\nEdenshaw and nephew of the Haida artist Charles Galdstone, who had began to push Haida artistic\nboundaries. Gladstone and Edenshaw were among the first Haida artists to access new mediums and\ntechnologies introduced by Europeans, such as various metals and industrialised carving tools. In their\ntraditional artistic practices they were both totem pole carvers and made copper bracelets and hair\npendants adorned with traditional Haida designs. With the introduction of European culture and new\nmaterials and tools, they also began making objects such as brooches and napkin rings using gold and\nsilver. Edenshaw knew, as every great Native artist before him, how to push the limits of design while\nadhering to the traditional vocabulary of Native art. (5)\nReid sometimes claimed that his grandfather, Charles Gladstone, had instructed him in the lore, history\nand tradition of the Haida people when he was in his early teens. (6). Charles Edenshaw trained directly\nunder his uncle Charles Gladstone and started to develop his skills as a young carver and jewellery\nmaker after a long visit with his uncle in 1897. As he was making the career transition from radio\nbroadcaster to artist in the 1950s, Bill Reid visited his uncle Charles Edenshaw to train under him on\nseveral occasions. The Haida artistic lineage, therefore, was passed from Gladstone to Edenshaw to\nReid in accordance with Haida customary law. From the beginning of his artistic career, Reid set out to\ncontinue along the path of Gladstone and Edenshaw in transforming the Haida artistic tradition. After\ncompleting a two year jewellery making course at Ryerson Institute of Technology in the early 1950s,\nReid told a reporter, Rhodi Lake, that \u201che wanted to apply the principles of contemporary jewellery-\nmaking to Haida art\u2026 in order to cultivate a 20th century audience for his work. (7).\nAnother important of aspect Reid\u2019s legacy is that he set out to move indigenous art out the commonly\nheld perception of unevolving folkloric work to be viewed in museums, to the status of high art to be\nviewed in galleries. In this effort Reid had a part in organising an exhibit of indigenous art called \u201cThe\nArts and Handicrafts Show\u201d at the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1954, and also exhibited jewellery in the\nshow. In the mid 1950s, Reid also undertook many visits to Haida Gwai to salvage many of the ancient\ntotem poles, study them, and carve new poles, masks and sculptures based on his interpretation of the\nHaida tradition. Reid believed that traditional Haida aesthetics could be improved upon. For example,\nhe stated that he did not like the shapes of some of the faces and noses on the ancient poles, so he was\ngoing to shape them differently. In spring of the 1959, Reid resigned from his job at the CBC (8) in\norder to work full time on a project recreating a Haida village at the Museum of Anthropology (MOA)\nat the University of British Columbia (UBC) with the assistance of Nimkish carver Doug Cranmer.\n207\n\nReid's and Cranmer\u2019s work on the project received some attention at the time because of the tools they\nwere using. Reid often spoke with passion about his tools, most of which he made up himself (based on\nadaptations of traditional tools). At the same time he appreciated the speed of power tools. (9). The\nMOA UBC project was the time indigenous carvers publicly used chain saws to do the bucking and\nroughing-out work on totem poles.\nThroughout his career as an artist Reid also associated and worked with many Haida and other\nindigenous artists who informed his work. Throughout the 1960s through to the 1990s he continued his\ninnovations of Haida symbols in jewellery, mask, and totem pole making. Through repousee, casting,\nsoldering and silver overlay, Ried had extended Northwest coast jewellery into three dimensions\n(whereas) past technology only allowed shallow engraving of designs on metal surfaces. (10) He also\nmade large wood carvings the size of which had not been seen before in the Haida tradition (i.e. Bear\nSculpture 1962 and Raven and the First Man 1980) and bronze cast even larger monumental sculptures\n(i.e. Killer Whale 1985 and The Spirit of Haida Gwaii 1989) which represented the first time that\nmedium had been applied to Haida art.\nIndigenous national artistic licence\nAt the end of his career he had become an icon in the Canadian art world and was regarded an\nambassador and hero of the Haida nation. Reid\u2019s transformation of Haida art\u2014based on the use of new\ntechnologies, the development of new forms, and the use of new mediums\u2014gradually earned him the\nstatus of master artist, which in turn allowed him to train younger Haida artists such as Robert\nDavidson. His status as master artist was granted because he did pay homage to the Haida traditions and\nbegan his work in accordance with to Haida customary law\u2014which he also paid homage to throughout\nhis career, while at the same time breaking new ground. These aspects of Reid\u2019s work afforded him a\ntype of \u201clicense\u201d from the Haida nation to transform their artistic traditions in a respectful manner.\nThis concept of \u201clicense\u201d is a type of \u201cpermission to innovate TK\u201d that characterises part of the\nrelationship between the indigenous artist and the indigenous nation to which they belong, and could be\ntermed \u201cindigenous national artistic license.\u201d The concept of indigenous national artistic license\nrepresents an example of the evolutional nature of customary law\u2019s ability to adapt to contemporary\ncontexts.\nKey concepts in developing traditional knowledge regulation in the arts\nIt is clear that there are pressing issues in the regulation of TK in the arts. It is also clear that there are\nproblems to which the IPR system and other Eurocentric concepts do not offer a solution. Such\ndiscrepancies between the TK and the IP system have led certain academics and indigenous peoples to\nreject the current system in its entirety. Some have argued that the protection of TK requires the\nestablishment of an entirely new system. In the developing literature and discourse, this proposed new\nsystem is usually referred to as \u201cSui Generis.\u201d An \u201cintellectual property-like\u201d system could be adopted\nto suit TK needs. The TK/IP interface forces us to re-evaluate IP fundamentals. The central question in\nthis debate is, can IP be a truly global system recognising various forms of traditional creations and\ninnovations, and grant some protection to collective rights holders?\nBased on the discussion of issues outlined in this paper, new regimes of protection and regulation for\nTK in the Arts could combine aspects of customary law and Eurocentric Law and should incorporate\nthe following key principles:\n1. a) Indigenous nations have a collective ownership over their TK, which could be\nexpressed as a form of \u201ccollective copyright.\u201d\nb) In the development of a \u201ccollective copyright\u201d system, a \u201ccollective royalty\u201d system\ncould also be considered. Another consideration could be that royalty payments for the\nuse of TK could go into established Indigenous Nations Arts Funds and/or scholarships\nand/or an established National Indigenous Arts Fund and/or scholarship.\n2. Indigenous nations\u2019 TK has a natural form of moral rights, which could be expressed as\n\u201ccollective moral rights.\u201d\n3. New regimes of protection for TK should be based on and/or incorporate customary law.\n4. In cases of conflict between regimes, customary law should prevail over eurocentric law.\n208\n\n5. Certain aspects of TK should not enter the public domain (as deemed under customary law)\nand should remain protected as such into perpetuity, which could be expressed as a form of\n\u201cindigenous private domain.\u201d\n6. Indigenous artists have indigenous national artistic license that grants them permission to\nadapt their particular indigenous nations\u2019 TK in their work.\n7. Non-indigenous people and indigenous peoples from other indigenous nations do not have\nindigenous national artistic license that grants them permission to adapt their particular\nindigenous nations\u2019 TK in their work.\n8. Non-indigenous people and indigenous peoples from other indigenous nations should attain\nprior informed consent in use of a particular indigenous nations TK in art (and other tangible\ncommercial objects).\na) Enforcement of infringements of TK regulation should incorporate the concept of\n\u201ccultural harm\u201d and damages should reflect the severity of the harm.\nb) Reimbursement payments for profits made from unauthorised use of TK could also be\nconsidered. These payments could be made to the same established funds suggested in\n1.b above.\nConclusions\nThere is clearly a perceived need to legislate a sui generis system to match identified needs of TK\nholders. On the other hand, some would argue that resorting to a sui generis system should be a solution\nof last resort, because it usually indicates that instead of finding out why the system does not work, a\n\u201ctailored\u201d system is legislatively put in place without necessarily thinking about its impact on the\nexisting system. In order to avoid stretching the current IP canvas beyond what is reasonable; a sui\ngeneris regime could be established and extended through a new international instrument. This could\nhappen much more easily once the countries most advanced in the consideration of this issue have\nadopted and tested certain forms of protection of TK and shown that these new forms of protection\nactually work and meet the needs and expectations of TK holders.\nInternational discussions around TK are ongoing in such international forums as UNESCO, WIPO, The\nConvention on Bio-Diversity (CBD), and the TRIPs Agreement within the WTO. The most active of\nthese forums on issues of TK has been WIPO's Intergovernmental Committee on Traditional\nKnowledge, Genetic Resources and Folklore (IGC). The IGC has done more research on TK by far than\nany other international body through its first mandate which expired in June 2003. At the final meeting\nof the IGC first mandate, the 179 member states overwhelmingly expressed the view that a sui generis\ninternational instrument to protect TK must be developed.\nThe IGC also recognised, for the first time, that indigenous peoples must have a voice and input into the\nIGC process. The IGC June 2003 meeting also heard presentations from ten member states who have\ndeveloped sui generis legislation to protect TK including Nigeria, Zambia, Brazil, China, Costa Rica,\nPeru, Philippines, Portugal, Thailand and the U.S. (Sui generis TK legislation has also been\nimplemented in Panama and is in the process of development in South Africa). Now going into its\nsecond mandate, indications are that the IGC is moving from a research to a political mandate (Craig,\n2003).\nAt the Sixth Session of the IGC in March 2004 a proposal for an International Instrument (Document\n6/12) and a proposal for the IGC to work collaboratively with the Parties to the Convention on\nBiodiversity (CBD) (Documents 6/13) emerged as the key issues. After long debates over the 6/13 CBD\nproposal, the Chair concluded that no consensus could be reached; therefore, the matter was referred\nback to the WIPO General Assembly.\nDocument 6/12 was a proposal submitted by the African Group containing principles and objectives for\nthe drafting of a binding International Instrumental for the protection of Traditional Knowledge,\nFolklore and Genetic Resources. Some debate over particular elements of 6/12 ensued, but the member\nstates generally agreed that the document provided a good basis to move forward on the issue. The\nmember states also generally agreed that national frameworks for sui generis legislation for Traditional\nKnowledge, Folklore and Genetic Resources should continue, complimentary to the work the IGC\nshould undertake to accelerate the process of drafting a binding International Instrument(s). The\nSecretariat has also initiated research on the application of indigenous customary law in the\n209\n\ninternational instrument(s). A statement of principles to be incorporated into an International\nInstrument(s) was also presented by a group of indigenous NGOs who had held caucuses throughout the\nsession.\nWhile international efforts continue to discuss and develop regulations for TK protection,\ncomplimentary efforts must be made on domestic fronts at the same time. Countries with wide-spread\nabuse of TK in the arts and other areas, like Canada and Australia, must move quickly to bring about\ndomestic regimes of protection that will be in line with developing international regimes. The Carpet\nCase and the Bulan Bulan Case in Australia have begun the process by establishing indigenous\ncopyright (the same protective mechanism that started the European IP system), although the Court\nstopped short of recognising collective copyright. In Bulan Bulan this was done on what could be seen\nas an erroneous attempt to apply the concept of indigenous collective ownership to the concept of \u201cjoint\nauthorship.\u201d Test cases on TK and Australia\u2019s relatively new moral rights regime are impending.\nIn Canada, the contradictory judgements of the Snow and the Berge cases leave all creative works\nrelative to moral rights in question, let alone TK, and further tests are also required. Meanwhile, the\nSCC has yet to consider the existence of a collective Aboriginal Right to ownership and control of\nAboriginal cultural property. (11). Again, test cases are required in Canada. Meanwhile Canada and\nAustralia need to begin the process of working with indigenous groups on the development of new\nregimes or face the problems of conflicting binding regimes when international standards are set.\nThe indigenous humanities and visual arts are integral to the renewal and revitalisation of indigenous\nknowledge (Henderson, 2004), yet they continue to be exploited unabated by appropriators who often\ncan use the IP system to protect themselves. The IP system was conceived and developed independently\nof the TK system and later imposed upon the TK system through the colonisation process. The IP\nsystem never took into account indigenous cultural protocols, or the intrinsic value of TK, yet its\neconomic institutions now exploit TK while indigenous peoples remain the most economically deprived\npopulation in the world. National and international sui generis regimes of protection for TK based on\nTK protocols and current global economic realities are required to resolve the situation and must be\ncreated with the participation of indigenous peoples.\nBibliography\nBell, C., & Paterson, R.
